<h1>Progress Update #1 on Sanatorium LEB</h1>
<h3>(3rd February 2024)</h3>
<p><span class="desc">This is the first Progress Update for Sanatorium-LEB as a battle map!
    There are some things most imporantly regarding special properties with the Soul Lantern item.
     Alot of the map has been built but it's no where near completetion as theres a copule of more things to work on.
      One of these are the Special Properties for the Soul Lanterns.
       These Special Properties are boosted regeneration on player kills but at the cost of having weakness at all times while having the item in the player's inventory.
       Another thing is custom advancements made for Sanatorium!
        And also keep an eye for the secrets. Especially if you bring a light source with you.
