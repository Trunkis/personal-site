    <h1>Mobberode and Experiments</h1>
    <h3>(15th March 2024)</h3>
    <p> <span class="desc">
        Latest news for Mobberode is the new experiments! These experiments are basically Mobberode: Mutated features but limited and less advanced. You can enable these experiments by using commands.
        More on that later, there is a Buy Station experiment that makes players able to buy stuff. So far you can buy back people, get effects and buy food. To enable this is to change #Config zsc.experiment_buy_station to 1, or 0 if you want to disable it.
        Be Mobberoding!
