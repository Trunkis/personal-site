    <h1>Introducing ZSExtensions and Exo-Movements!</h1>
    <h3>(19th February 2024)</h3>
    <p> <span class="desc">
        Today is the day where Mobberode introduces ZS/MBExtensions! This is basically mods/addons for any Mobberode based game. The first public extension thats going to be shown is Exo-Movements!
        Exo-Movements is a extension for ZSC/Mobberode and Necro Brawl. This gives 2 abilites for players to use. Dash and Powered Dash. Of course the Powered Dash is the stronger and longer one but both dashes give you one benefit. Ability to dash away and have resistance applied for 2 seconds. These are helpful in getting
        to those pumping high waves.</p>
